# Skin Lesions Classification Using MLP and SVM
### Abstract:
The accurate classification of skin lesions is crucial in the early diagnosis and treatment of skin cancers, particularly melanoma, which is one of the most lethal forms. This project presents a machine learning-based approach to classify skin lesions using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The project integrates computer vision techniques for image preprocessing and feature extraction, ensuring enhanced accuracy in the classification process. A publicly available dataset, the HAM10000, consisting of over 10,000 dermatoscopic images of various skin lesions, is utilized for training and evaluation. This dataset includes images of different types of lesions, providing a robust foundation for model generalization. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is developed to make the system user-friendly, allowing for easy input of skin lesion images and providing real-time classification results. The GUI also includes visualization features that highlight the regions of interest used in the decision-making process. The performance of the MLP and SVM models is evaluated on the HAM10000 dataset, with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score serving as benchmarks. This project aims to contribute to the medical field by providing an accessible tool for dermatologists and medical practitioners, thereby supporting early intervention strategies.

# Machine Learning / Computer Vision Mini Project – Plant Disease Detection 
### Abstract:
The integration of machine learning and computer vision in agriculture is transforming crop management by enabling precise
and early disease detection. This project presents a comprehensive machine learning pipeline that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
and advanced computer vision techniques to automatically detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images. The pipeline begins with image
preprocessing, where computer vision methods are applied for normalization, resizing, and data augmentation to enhance the model's robustness 
against variations in lighting and angle. The CNN model is then employed to perform feature extraction, learning intricate patterns and textures 
that distinguish between healthy and diseased plants. Transfer learning is utilized to adapt a pre-trained model, accelerating the training process 
while maintaining high accuracy. To further refine the model, hyperparameter tuning is conducted, optimizing performance and preventing overfitting. 
The system's effectiveness is measured using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics. This approach demonstrates the power of combining machine 
learning with computer vision to create scalable, accurate solutions for precision agriculture, ultimately aiming to reduce crop losses and improve food security.
